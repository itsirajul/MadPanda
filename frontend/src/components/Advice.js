          Lack of sleep can lead to serious health problems like type 2
          diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and depression. So, getting quality
          sleep is not a luxury, it’s a necessity. The good news is: Great sleep
          is within your reach.In today’s world, peace and quiet can be
          something of a rarity. The sound of neighbors laughing late into the
          night, your partner snoring, music playing from across the hall, a
          buzzing phone on the bedside table, a television left on— – there are
          an array of everyday noises that can disturb you and have detrimental
          effects given the importance of sleep on overall health. However,
          perfect silence isn’t always necessary or even desirable. Some sounds
          at night can actually enhance your sleep. Other sounds—a child crying,
          a smoke alarm ringing—are important to hear, even during sleep. If
          you’re anxious about the booming noise levels of the world around you,
          there are steps you can take to battle the noise pollution. The goal
          is to figure out how to protect against the unwanted and intrusive
          sounds, and how to stay asleep throughout the entire night.

        <b>How Does Noise Affect Your Sleep</b>

        <em>
          If you are wondering how to fall asleep fast, be aware that noise
          tends to be most disruptive during your light stages of sleep, which
          occur at the beginning of the night and in recurring periods
          throughout the night. It’s also possible for noises to rouse you from
          deep sleep and REM sleep. To get the sleep that you need, it’s
          important to protect your sleep environment against unwanted sound for
          the duration of your night’s rest. Noise at night can prevent you from
          falling asleep initially, and sounds during the night can wake you
          leaving you unable to return to sleep. Even noises that don’t wake you
          can have a detrimental effect on sleep quality. While you snooze, the
          sleeping brain continues to register and process sound. Noises can
          create restlessness in sleep even if they don’t wake you fully, and
          these interruptions affect sleep quality and the movement from lighter
          to deeper stages of sleep.
